Code Approach

1. Grid System Implementation
   Grid Canvas:

A flexbox or CSS grid layout is used for the canvas to define predefined snapping positions.
Components "snap" to the nearest grid position using drag-and-drop libraries like react-dnd or react-beautiful-dnd.
Positioning is calculated using mouse coordinates and the grid’s cell dimensions.
State Management:

Component positions and properties are stored in a centralized state, such as React Context, Redux, or Zustand.
Updates are sent to the backend using Remix Actions for persistence. 2. Admin View
Draggable Components:

Components in the navigation drawer are wrapped in a drag source.
The grid canvas acts as a drop target.
Drag-and-Drop:

Dragging updates the position of the component relative to the grid.
Drop events trigger functions to save the updated layout.
Configuration Saving:

The grid’s state is serialized into a JSON structure and sent to the backend via Remix Actions (action functions). 3. User View
Fetching Quiz Data:

Quiz configurations are fetched using Remix Loaders (loader functions).
Data is loaded on the server and passed as props to the client.
Quiz Interaction:

Components like Progress Bar, Question Number, Timer, and Options render dynamically based on the fetched configuration.
State is managed for user interactions (e.g., selected options, timer countdown).
Answer Validation:

User inputs are validated against pre-stored correct answers in the backend.
Validation logic is invoked upon submission. 4. Backend Integration
A mock backend can be set up using JSON files or services like json-server. 5. Responsive Design
Tailwind CSS utilities are used for responsiveness (sm, md, lg classes).

1. Remix Loaders & Actions

Loaders: Fetch quiz configurations and questions.
Actions: Save grid state and quiz configurations. 2. TypeScript & Tailwind CSS

TypeScript: Ensures type safety.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first styling approach. 3. Validations

Custom validations for intuitive grid functionality. 4. Accessibility

Implement ARIA roles and keyboard navigation enhancements.
Development
Prerequisites

Node.js installed on your system.
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Run Locally

Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Build for Production

Build the project:
bash
Copy code
npm run build
Start the production server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
How It Works
Admin Workflow

Drag components from the navigation drawer to the grid.
Configure components as needed.
Save the setup using Remix Actions.
User Workflow

Fetch quiz setup using Remix Loaders.
Interact with the quiz and submit answers.
View answer validations.
Styling
Framework: Tailwind CSS.
Customization: Modify styles in tailwind.config.js and component classnames.
Accessibility
Keyboard Navigation: Full keyboard operability.
Focus Management: Visual cues and intuitive tab navigation
